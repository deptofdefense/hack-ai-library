I'm not sure there are any, but keeping this here as a note to look for them

### Articles and Op-Eds

Just basic articles, books and white papers will be a different section

### Videos

Other videos as well as our own.  We can add the AI village talks as a subsection within here to keep them seperate from everything else.

Ideally these will be ebooks with links we can reference, but titles and authhors are also fine.
